# This workspace file provides export settings for any MountainTiles 
# projects in the same directory.
# These settings are used for the "File -> Export from workspace..." menu item.

# This section defines the default export settings for any projects not covered by
# any `[project]` section (see example below)
[default.export]

# If specified, all maps in the project are exported to a set of Rust modules in this file
# Note this is relative to the location of this file.
module-path = "export/src/default_maps.rs"

# If specified, tileset images are exported to files based on this path, which
# must be in the form of a filename rather than a directory.
# Since there are multiple possible formats, the filename will be modified to
# reflect the format. You can either omit the extension or use an arbitrary one like 
# ".ext" as shown here.
# The modified filenames are as follows:
# - PNG - replace/add the extension ".png"
# - 1bit raw data - replace/add the extension ".raw"
tileset-path = "export/tilesets/default_tilesets.ext"

# Export tilesets as a png image.
# To export, this must be true, and `tileset-path` must also be specified.
tileset-png = true

# Export tilesets as a 1bit raw image.
# To export, this must be true, and `tileset-path` must also be specified.
tileset-1bit = false

# This section defines the export settings for any project with a filename matching
# the second part, in this case "instructions". So this would apply to projects that have
# been saved as "instructions.mnp".
# The contents are the same as for `[default.export]` above.
# The project name must be quoted as necessary for TOML (e.g. if it has spaces)
[project.instructions.export]
